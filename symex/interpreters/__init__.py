"""Interpreters for evaluating Lisp expressions

These are the interpretersâ€”the code responsible for actually evaluating an
expression to obtain a value.

Currently, there are two interpreters:

* `symex.interpreters.simple` is a relatively simple interpreter.
* `symex.interpreters.machine` is a more complicated interpreter that uses an
  explicit call stack.

The advantage of `machine` over `simple` is that `machine` is implemented
non-recursively, and as a result, it uses only a few frames on Python's call
stack, no matter how deep the recursive calls in Lisp go. On the other hand,
`simple` uses a lot of recursive calls, and as a result, it may end up
overflowing the stack even when doing something as simple as mapping a function
over a list containing 1,000 elements.

The `machine` interpreter will probably be abandoned and eventually deleted,
since its design is poor. In particular, it attempts to directly interpret the
syntax tree (which is, of course, recursive) using a non-recursive algorithm. As
a result, the logic is very difficult to follow.

In its place, there's going to be an interpreter which first translates Lisp
expressions into a form that is easy to execute non-recursively, and then
executes that.
